# unveilingMilan

This Project is to show a new perspectice of what a tourist usually see, Milan in a different view, where it unveil what's behind.
I use Glitch art to really create a link, which is that the images are created by some errors, i manipulate the images with a program called HxD where it reveal the behind
of a digital image i.e. made by data.
I made this project for the course of Use of Web Software at Brera Academy of Fine Arts taken by prof. Domenico Quaranta.
